Tried and Tested Best Practices for Docker Builds

What do I want to cover?

The general principles of the Docker build system:

1. Local / Remote Parity
2. Easy to use, easy to customise
3. Agnostic to internal technology
4. Easy to use with CI/CD systems
5. Enterprise friendly

Antipattern

1. Remote docker builds (a local build should be promotable)
