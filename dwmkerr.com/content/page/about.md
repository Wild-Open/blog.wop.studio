I have been developing software for many years. Starting out in C, moving into C++ and then C# and the .NET Framework. More recently I've been working with JavaScript and the MEAN stack. I have worked as a web developer, web designer and a software developer for everything from device drivers to full enterprise applications.

I am also the secretary and co-founder of the charity [Namaste – Children’s Homes Nepal](http://www.childrenshomesnepal.org).
