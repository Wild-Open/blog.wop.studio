title: Composite Data Service Framework
---


<p>Today I start a new project - the Composite Data Service Framework.&nbsp;The Composite Data Service Framework is a project that aims to obviate some of the limitations of WCF Data Services, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing multiple data services to be aggregated in a single data service.</li>
<li>Providing more support for Service Operations (such as auto-generation of proxies client-side).</li>
<li>Aggregating different service types (entity framework, CLR types etc)</li>
<li>Complementing OData services with traditional WCF services with a single definition of proxies client-side.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is in its early stages and is hosted at:</p>
