title: Trials and Tribulations with SharpGL 2.0
---


<p>SharpGL has not been updated for a while, the original CoreProject article is at: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/openGL/sharpgl.aspx">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/openGL/sharpgl.aspx</a></p>
<p>Recently I have begun work on SharpGL 2.0, with plans to address some of the issues people have had with SharpGL 1.83. In preparation there is a public accessible repository on CodePlex: <a href="http://sharpgl.codeplex.com/">http://sharpgl.codeplex.com/</a>&nbsp;check it soon, it will shortly be online.</p>
<p>Trying to squeeze acceptible performance from SharpGL has so far been an interesting task, I have found out many interesting things on the way, I'll be posting small snippets as I work on SharpGL 2.0 describing how I'm improving the performance and structure of the library.</p>
