This series focuses on building applications with AngularJS. It assumes no prior knowledge.

[Part 1 – Introducing AngularJS](/practical-angularjs-part1)

What is AngularJS? What’s it for and when should we use it? We look into the basics of AngularJS – controllers, models and scopes, as well as how to use common directives like ng-model and ng-repeat. We see how client side logic is improved with AngularJS and how we can handle unit testing.

[Part 2 – Components of an AngularJS Application](/practical-angularjs-part2)

We take a look into what is in the AngularJS developers toolkit- filters, controllers, services, directives and routing.
