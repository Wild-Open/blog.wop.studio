title: Practical AngularJS Part 2

I'm going to be working in F# almost exclusively for a short while, so before I throw myself into that I wanted to wind up my Practical AngularJS Part 2 article. It's ready to rock here:

<a title="Practical AngularJS Part 2 â€“ Components of an AngularJS Application" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/practical-angularjs-part2/">Practical AngularJS Part 2 - Components of an AngularJS Application</a>

In this article we get a brief introduction to what's in the toolkit for an angular developers - filters, controllers, services, directives, views and routes. I don't go into too much detail, we're just seeing what the different components are. Spread the word, share the article and as always, comments are welcome.
