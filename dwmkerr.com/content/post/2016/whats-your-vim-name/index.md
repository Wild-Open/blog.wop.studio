title: What's your Vim Name?
---


I'm a few weeks into moving to Vim as my main editor, I've stopped crying and shaking mostly (at least about my editing ability).

Now I'm wondering: what's your Vim name? And who's got the best one?

As far as I can work out, my Vim name is:

```
Replace everything from the cursor to the end of the line with 've'.
```

Which is what happens if I get bored and type my name (Dave) into Vim.

Has anyone out there got a name which does something cool in Vim?

### federico - Keep it Casual

Given a file like:

```
Hello, world!
```

`federico` transforms this into:

```
Hi, world!
```

Which is pretty cool :)
