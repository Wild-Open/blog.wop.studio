I don't know when I learnt that Windows + E opened up Windows Explorer. It must have been a while ago. But it's imprinted in my muscle memory, the number of times I hit that combo every day is probably quite high. But how many other hotkeys do I use? Asides from a few other functional ones, like Win + D, I don't use hotkeys so much. And I got to thinking, I'd love to open Google Chrome with a hotkey just like I do with explorer.

So I wrote FireKeys - a lightweight application that lets you assign hotkeys to actions. These actions could be opening program, a folder or a URL, but the underlying model is designed to be extensible.

You can get the tool from the <a title="FireKeys" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/firekeys/">FireKeys</a>Â page. There's an article on how it was developed on the CodeProject, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/559500/FireKeys-Open-Programs-Folders-or-URLs-with-Hot-Ke">FireKeys - Open Programs, Folders and URLs with Hot Keys</a>.
