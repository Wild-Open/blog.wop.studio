title: MVVM Commanding
---


<p>I have written an article that describes commanding in WPF, Silverlight and WP7 in detail. It is on the CodeProject at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/consistentmvvmcommands.aspx">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/consistentmvvmcommands.aspx</a></p>
<p>It uses the latest version of Apex (version 1.2) which will be released formally shortly. Enjoy!</p>
