There have been some problems with the version of Switch uploaded to the Visual Studio Gallery. I've created a new version of Switch (1.4) and uploaded this - it works fine now, for Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012.

You can find out more about this extension on the <a title="Switch" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/switch/">Switch Page</a>.
