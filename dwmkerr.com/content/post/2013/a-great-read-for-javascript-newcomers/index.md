title: A great read for JavaScript newcomers
---


A superb article by Colin Eberhardt has just been published on the CodeProject, called 'Understanding JavaScript Object Creation Patterns'.

This article should be on the reading list of anyone who's new to JavaScript or not familiar with how objects and prototypes work. It takes you step by step through the basics all the way to protoypes and classes.

The article is at:

I'd strongly recommend it!
