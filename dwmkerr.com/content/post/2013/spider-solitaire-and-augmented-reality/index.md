title: Spider Solitaire and Augmented Reality
---


A while ago, I made an implementation of Solitaire and Spider Solitaire using WPF and my Apex MVVM library. I wrote about it on the CodeProject, in an article called <a title="Solitaire and Spider Solitaire for WPF" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/252152/Solitaire-and-Spider-Solitaire-for-WPF">Solitaire and Spider Solitaire for WPF</a> (imaginative title indeed).

Anyway, just recently I got a very interesting message from rupam rupam, who has made an augmented reality version of the project! In his application, you use your webcam to play the game physically by picking up cards with gestures. Other gestures, like thumbs up and thumbs down are bound to commands in the game - here's a screenshot:

The project is called GesCard and as far as I know there isn't a page showing the code - but there are more links on the YouTube video for the page. Check out the YouTube video with the link hereÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOjuPdBooI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOjuPdBooI</a>. Thanks to rupam for getting in touch and sharing this very cool code!
