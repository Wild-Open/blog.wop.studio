If you take a look at the<a title="Introducing Experiments" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/2013/08/introducing-experiments/"> Experiments Page</a> you'll see that there's a new entry - <a title="Space Invaders" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/experiments/spaceinvaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a>.

Space Invaders is a great little game to code if you're learning a new language or technology (and JavaScript is still very much in that category for me). I'll be writing up how I made the game on the CodeProject soon enough (if you're interested you can <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/642499/Learn-JavaScript-Part-1-Create-a-Starfield" target="_blank">see how I made the starfield background in JavaScript</a>).

You can check back periodically - the game is nearly done and more than ready to play with. The code is available as well, either just get it from the browser or check <a title="Space Invaders on GitHub" href="http://github.com/dwmkerr/spaceinvaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders on GitHub</a>. I'll post when it's done and the next experiment starts!
