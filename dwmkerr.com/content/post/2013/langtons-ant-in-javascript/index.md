title: Langton's Ant in Javascript
---


Langton's Ant is a great simulation to write to play with a language. Just today I've completed my Langton's Ant write up and published it on the CodeProject, you can see the article at <a title="Learn Javascript Part 3 - AngularJS and Langton's Ant" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/696943/Learn-JavaScript-Part-3-AngularJS-and-Langtons-Ant" target="_blank">Learn JavaScript Part 3 - Angularjs and Langton's Ant</a>.

There are some interesting things in the article for angular too - a look at using directives for custom elements, how to handle both the DOM and Angular loading correctly, and timers and intervals. This is the third part on my series on Learn Javascript, the next will focus on NodeJS. Enjoy, share, fork and comments are always welcome.

The default configuration of the simulation is interesting - try a simulation of the form 'left, left, right, right' for another type of behaviour.
