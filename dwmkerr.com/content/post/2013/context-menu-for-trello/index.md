I'm on holiday at the moment, back in sunny England. Holiday may not be the right term really, I'm mostly working through charity stuff (for my charity <a title="Namaste - Children's Homes Nepal" href="http://www.childrenshomesnepal.org/" target="_blank">Namaste - Children's Homes Nepal</a>) and company administration. I'm also starting working on a big new project, which is pretty exciting.

Anyway, I got a nice message from a fellow coder <a title="Goerge Hahn on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/George_Hahn" target="_blank">George Hahn</a> who has put together a pretty cool project that lets you send files directly to <a title="Trello" href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> as an attachment to a card, or even as a new card. Here's a screenshot of it in action:

It's a nice project, you can check it out on GitHub:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><iframe style="width: 170px; height: 30px;" src="http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=GeorgeHahn&amp;repo=TrelloContextMenu&amp;type=watch&amp;count=true&amp;size=large" height="30" width="170" frameborder="0" scrolling="0"></iframe></td>
<td><iframe style="width: 170px; height: 30px;" src="http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=GeorgeHahn&amp;repo=TrelloContextMenu&amp;type=fork&amp;count=true&amp;size=large" height="30" width="170" frameborder="0" scrolling="0"></iframe></td>
<td><iframe style="width: 240px; height: 30px;" src="http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=GeorgeHahn&amp;type=follow&amp;count=true&amp;size=large" height="30" width="240" frameborder="0" scrolling="0"></iframe></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
What's also cool about this project is that it's the first project that someone's told me about that uses <a title="SharpShell" href="https://sharpshell.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">SharpShell</a>. Many people have got in touch with me about SharpShell (in fact, <a title="SharpShell Context Menus on the CodeProject" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/512956/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Context-Menus" target="_blank">the SharpShell Context Menus article on the CodeProject</a> is very popular), but so far this is the first real-world project where the writer got in touch after the project is completed.

Thanks George, I look forward to seeing what else you're working on!
