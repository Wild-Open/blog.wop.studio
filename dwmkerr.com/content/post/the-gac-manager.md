<p>I have started a new project on CodePlex called 'GAC Manager'. This is a project that is in two parts, the first is a simple tool to allow users to manipulate their local global assembly cache, the second is an API that provides the core functionality.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the tool in its current state:</p>

<p>An article on the project is available on the CodeProject at:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/430568/A-GAC-Manager-Utility-and-API">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/430568/A-GAC-Manager-Utility-and-API</a></p>
<p>The project itself is at:&nbsp;<a href="https://gacmanager.codeplex.com/">https://gacmanager.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<p>As always, comments, feature requests and so on are welcome!</p>
