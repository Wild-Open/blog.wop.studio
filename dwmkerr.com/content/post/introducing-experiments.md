title: Introducing Experiments
---


I'm staring a series of articles on learning Javascript (the first is available atÂ <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/642499/Learn-JavaScript-Part-1-Create-a-Starfield">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/642499/Learn-JavaScript-Part-1-Create-a-Starfield</a>). To help with this, I've created the <a title="Experiments" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/experiments">Experiments</a> page. This page will host each of the things I've been playing with in the process of learning JavaScript and coming up with good topics for tutorials.

You can see the <a title="Experiments" href="http://www.dwmkerr.com/experiments">Experiments</a> page here, there's also a link at the top of the site. If you like it, please feel free to comment on this post or get in touch.
