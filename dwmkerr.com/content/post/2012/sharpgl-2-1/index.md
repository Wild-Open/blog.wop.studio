For those who are interested, I'm now starting development of SharpGL 2.1. SharpGL 2.1 will primarily be a release to implement features and fix bugs that users have added to the Codeplex site. The actual features and bugs that'll be sorted are on the CodePlex site - just search for release 'SharpGL 2.1'.

This will also be the first release of SharpGL that will be published on Nuget.
