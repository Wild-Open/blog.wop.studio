title: Supercharge Your Open Source Projects
---

I love the world of open-source. Communities of people working together to solve problems, people who are working on things just for the sheer passion of the topic, and the spirit of collaboration. This is one of the things which really keeps me inspired and engaged with technology.

I have contributed to a number of open-source projects over the years, but also built up a healthy number of projects of my own:

Obviously these are not hugely popular projects, but they get activity and usage, and take a reasonable amount of time to maintain. Looking a little bit deeper, with the excellent [`starz`](https://github.com/yyx990803/starz) tool, there's actually quite a few projects which have a reasonable following[^1]:

```

I take a huge amount of pleasure out of knowing that things I've maintained are being used, messages from users and these (admitidly minor) contributions to the community!

Over the years that I've been writing and publishing online (about ten years) I've learnt a few good pratices along the way, which I thought might be useful to share.

I'd love any additional suggestions, and will gladly update this article with any other tips from the community.

**Disclaimer**: I've not implemented all of these pratices in all of my projects, many are great ideas I've seen in other places! I've tried to include a link in each section to a great example, please share if you have better ones.

1: What is a reasonable following? I'd love to know if anyone has any good metrics on what constitutes an active/very active project!
